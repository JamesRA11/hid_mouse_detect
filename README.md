# Local Mouse HID Attack Detection System

This program is a lightweight, local anomaly detection system designed to monitor and detect abnormal mouse input behavior. It uses machine learning to identify suspicious patterns in HID reports, such as those potentially generated by injected USB packets or malicious drivers.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of mouse HID input
- Feature extraction from raw HID movement and click data
- Supervised machine learning model for anomaly detection
- High detection accuracy with minimal impact on performance
- Fully local â€” no data transmission or network dependency

## Use Case

This project is suitable for detecting:
- Hardware-based mouse injection attacks
- Malicious drivers generating fake mouse movement
- Anomalies caused by compromised HID devices

It was developed for **COMP6841** course project at UNSW.

## Use
- Python 3.11.9 required
- Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download essential packages
- Run `realtime_mouse_detector.py` and it will automatically detect your mouse behavior and report if anything suspecious
